# jrpm
*jrpm*, or *JakeGuy11's Rust Password Manager* is a password manager built in Rust, mainly in order to help me learn Rust. This will mainly be for personal use, but I do plan on updating this readme with things like install instructions in the future.

For those concerned about how secure the program can be if its source code is public: yeah, it's probably not *great* to have the source code public. However, the fact that (a) this is a very small tool with very few non-me users, (b) the encrypted data is stored locally, and (c) it relies on a secret key that's also stored locally, outweigh the risks of publicizing the souce code.
